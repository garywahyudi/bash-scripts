# bash-scripts
Here goes the list of the scripts I made for automation & probably Linux related stuff:

1. [setup-linux.sh](scripts/setup-linux.sh): Download and setting up Ubuntu-based software stuff.

Here are the software included:    
- VSCodium
- Brave
- Nicotine+
- GNS3
- Mikrotik ISO
- QEMU/KVM + VirtManager*
- Neovim
- VLC
- Wget
- OBS-Studio (Flatpak)
- Blender (Flatpak)
- Wine64

*= It is commented since requiring more steps such as adding user to usergroups and then validating the installation itself.
